# Blindies Condictor App

This is a java / swing application that broadcasts UDP commands to the wireless Blindie modules

To operate, ensure your computer is on the same network as the Blindie units and you are broadcasting to .255 on the same port the untis are listening.

Run the jar file with:

`java -jar Blindies.jar`
